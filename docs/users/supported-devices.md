Felix86 requires `rv64gv_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs` to work. RVA23 supports all of these extensions, so boards with RVA23 such as future Spacemit K3 boards will be supported.

Spacemit K1 boards are also supported.

Some examples:

- Banana Pi F3 (has mPCIe slot)
- Milk-V Jupiter (has PCIe slot)
- DC-ROMA II
- Muse Pi Pro
- Orange Pi RV2

A board with a PCIe slot is preferred for connecting a discrete GPU.
